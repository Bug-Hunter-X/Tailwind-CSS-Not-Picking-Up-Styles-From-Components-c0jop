# Tailwind CSS - Missing Styles Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue where Tailwind CSS fails to apply styles to components. The problem stems from an incorrect or incomplete `content` array in the `tailwind.config.js` file.  This array must accurately list all the directories and files containing your template files (HTML, JSX, TSX etc.) for Tailwind to process and generate the necessary CSS.

## Bug Description

The application fails to apply Tailwind CSS styles correctly. Components are rendered without any styling or with incorrect styles, resulting in a broken or visually inconsistent user interface.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully checking the `content` option in your `tailwind.config.js`.  It must contain all your HTML, JSX, TSX, or other template files that include Tailwind directives like `class="..."`.  If you are using a framework like React, Vue, or Svelte, ensure that all your component files are correctly included.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start a development server (if applicable).
